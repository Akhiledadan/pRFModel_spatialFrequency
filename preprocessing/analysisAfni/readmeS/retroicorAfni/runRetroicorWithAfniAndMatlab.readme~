retroicor:

STUFF NEEDED + PREPARATION
code needed: generateRicorPredictor.m
             retroicorPredictor.m
             matlab toolbox provided with afni (file RetroTS.m and dependencies)

in the participant folder:

create directory ricordData/ 
put the physio files from the scanner in the directory (files extension=*.log)

create directory EPI/
put the epi files in the directory

¨optional¨
create directory stimTiming/
put the stimulus timing in the directory with the following specs:
one file for each condition, on each file, one line for each experimental run,
if the specific condition is not present in a single run, then write *
for that line (run).


GENERATE RETROICOR PREDICTORS:
go to the directory ricorData/
run the file generateRicorPredictor.m, this file will generate the files respData.dat and pulseData.data
and pass them to RetroTS.m in an appropriate structure;
The file RetroTs.m will generate a file oba%.slibase.1D for each run, this is the file 
that afni uses to apply retroicor.


IN CASE YOU WANT TO PERFORM HRF ESTIMATION OUTSIDE AFNI: 
run the following to obtain despiked, retroicor corrected, timeshifted
motioncorrected and scaled TSs.
NB. remember to change the the regular expression for the EPIs (line 42), in case
you are not using niftis. Also change the time-shift pattern, in case your pattern differs,
look at the afni_proc.py for patterns codes.

#!/bin/tcsh

afni_proc.py -subj_id singleRun \  
	-dsets EPI/*.nii	\
	-blocks despike ricor tshift volreg mask scale \
        -ricor_regs ricorData/*.1D           \
        -tshift_opts_ts -tpattern alt+z 


IN CASE YOU WANT TO PERFORM HRF ESTIMATION with AFNI: 
run the following to obtain despiked, retroicor corrected, timeshifted
motioncorrected and scaled TSs.
NB. remember to change the the regular expression for the EPIs (line 56), in case
you are not using niftis. Also change the time-shift pattern, in case your pattern differs,
look at the afni_proc.py for patterns codes. Also change the regular expression for the
stimulus timing definition (in case), the regression stim labels and the regress_basis
parameter (suggested = TENT).

afni_proc.py -subj_id singleRun \
	-dsets EPI/*.nii	\
	-blocks despike ricor tshift volreg mask scale regress	\
        -ricor_regs ricorData/*.1D           \
        -tshift_opts_ts -tpattern alt+z  	        \
	-regress_stim_times stimTiming/*.1D	\
	-regress_stim_labels SingleRun			\
	-regress_basis ...


cheers!
